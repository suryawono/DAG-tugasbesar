                Global Rule #3 is in effect. No anthropomorphic ("furry") or grotesque ("guro") images are permitted, and all images should depict "of age" participants. Images depicting bestiality, scat, or generally seen to be "extreme" in nature are not to be uploaded.

            <li>
                All images should be of high quality and high resolution. No doodles or garbage artwork. 4chan's moderation team will be the arbiters of what is and is not high quality.

                Please provide relevant information in your opening post where possible (e.g., source material, artist name, etc) in order to minimize requests for the source of an image.
