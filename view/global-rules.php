        <ol>
            <li>
                You will not upload, post, discuss, request, or link to anything that violates local or United States law.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will immediately cease and not continue to access the site if you are under the age of 18.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will not post any of the following outside of /b/: Trolls, flames, racism, off-topic replies, uncalled for catchphrases, macro image replies, indecipherable text (example: "lol u tk him 2da bar|?"), anthropomorphic ("furry") or grotesque ("guro") images, post number GETs ("dubs"), or loli/shota pornography.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will not post or request personal information ("dox") or calls to invasion ("raids"). Inciting or participating in cross-board (intra-4chan) raids is also not permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              All boards that default to the Yotsuba B or Burichan (blue) themes are to be considered "work safe." Violators may be temporarily banned and their posts removed. Note: Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards.
            </li>
            <li>
              The quality of posts is extremely important to this community. Contributors are encouraged to provide high-quality images and informative comments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Submitting false or misclassified reports, or otherwise abusing the reporting system may result in a ban. Replying to a thread stating that you've reported or "saged" it, or another post, is also not allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complaining about 4chan (its policies, moderation, etc) on the imageboards may result in post deletion and a ban.
            </li>
            <li>
              Evading your ban will result in a permanent one. Instead, wait and appeal it!
            </li>
            <li>
              No spamming or flooding of any kind. No intentionally evading spam or post filters.

            <li>
              Advertising (all forms) is not welcomeâ€”this includes any type of referral linking, "offers", soliciting, begging, stream threads, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Impersonating a 4chan administrator, moderator, or janitor is strictly forbidden.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not use avatars or attach signatures to your posts.
            </li>

              All request threads belong on /r/ unless otherwise noted.
            </li>
